For this assignment we are working on methods that we were introduced to in class of multiple linear regression.
I worked on this assignment alone. What we had to do was create a simple regression model that utilizes only one
feature, the log of the distance to the MRT station, to predict the house price/unit area, and find the model's metrics
,the R^2 and adjusted R^2, as well as the the coeffient (slope) of the line. And then create a multiple regression model
that utilizes all features in the dataset to predict the house price/unit area, and find the model's metrics ,the R^2 and adjusted R^2,
as well as the the coeffient for each variable.
