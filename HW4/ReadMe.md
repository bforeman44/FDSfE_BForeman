The purpose of this assignment is to use machine learning methods to find and plot the linear
relationship between the speed at which people walk and population size of the city within urban areas.
What I learned from doing this assignment is how to use statmodel.ols functions such to fit data points
and how to make predictions using machine learning. I did not have a partener when working on this.
