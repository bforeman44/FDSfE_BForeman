So to test that you can measure the trip duration for customers that are registered as male and customers that are registered as female and see (1) if they  have the same mean, and (2) if they are \"the same\" distribution (more precisely you will meausre if they come from the \"same parent distribution\"). \n",

That is, is the following true: mean1 - std1 <= mean2 <= mean1 + std1.
